# What's New in MicroProfile 7.1 Tutorial

The MicroProfile Tutorial has been updated to reflect the latest features and changes in MicroProfile 7.1. The following sections highlight the key updates.

## MicroProfile Rest Client 4.0

The tutorial now covers **MicroProfile Rest Client 4.0**, which introduces several improvements:

### Key Features and Changes

**1. Jakarta EE 10 Alignment**

* MicroProfile Rest Client 4.0 has been aligned with Jakarta EE 10 to ensure compatibility with modern cloud-native applications.
* It is**not compatible** with earlier versions of Jakarta EE or Java EE.

**2. Simplified `baseUri()` Configuration**

MicroProfile Rest Client 4.0 introduces a new convenience method that eliminates boilerplate code:

```java
// Before (Rest Client 3.x): Required explicit URI creation
URI productApiUri = URI.create("http://localhost:8080/api");
ProductServiceClient client = RestClientBuilder.newBuilder()
    .baseUri(productApiUri)
    .build(ProductServiceClient.class);

// Now (Rest Client 4.0): Direct String parameter
ProductServiceClient client = RestClientBuilder.newBuilder()
    .baseUri("http://localhost:8080/api")  // No URI.create() needed!
    .build(ProductServiceClient.class);
```

This simplifies client configuration and reduces unnecessary object creation.

**3. CDI `@RestClient` Qualifier Clarification**

* The `@RestClient` qualifier is **mandatory** when injecting REST clients in CDI environments
* This requirement has been explicitly clarified in the specification to avoid ambiguity

```java
@Inject
@RestClient  // Required - not optional
private ProductServiceClient productClient;
```

**4. Filter Priority Handling**

* Implementations must honor `@Priority` annotations on client request and response filters
* Ensures predictable and consistent filter execution order across different implementations

### Tutorial Updates

**Chapter 11** has been comprehensively updated to MicroProfile Rest Client 4.0, covering the following:

** Addtional Topics Coverage **

* **Jakarta EE 10 Alignment** - Complete namespace migration (`javax.*` → `jakarta.*`), breaking changes, and compatibility benefits
* **Defining REST Client Interfaces** - `@RegisterRestClient` usage, configKey configuration, and interface design patterns
* **CDI Integration** - Mandatory `@RestClient` qualifier, scope management (`@ApplicationScoped`, `@RequestScoped`), lifecycle management
* **MicroProfile Config Integration** - Complete configuration reference (URL, timeouts, scopes, providers, SSL/TLS), configuration precedence, environment-specific overrides
* **Parameter Configuration** - `@PathParam`, `@QueryParam`, `@HeaderParam`, `@BeanParam` with practical examples
* **Request & Response Handling** - All HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH), response types (DTO, `Response`, `void`, collections), `AutoCloseable` resource management
* **JSON & Multipart Data** - JSON-B automatic serialization, JSON-B annotations, multipart file uploads, JSON-P for dynamic processing
* **Error Handling** - `ResponseExceptionMapper` implementation, priority-based exception mapping, checked vs unchecked exceptions
* **RestClientBuilder API** - Programmatic client creation with new `baseUri(String)` method, complete configuration options (timeouts, SSL, proxies), when to use vs CDI injection
* **Custom Filters & Interceptors** - ClientRequestFilter/ClientResponseFilter for HTTP-level interception (authentication, logging, header manipulation), WriterInterceptor/ReaderInterceptor for entity-level processing (compression, encryption), execution order with `@Priority`, three registration methods

** Code Examples**

* Added code examples demonstrating real-world patterns
* Authentication filters (Basic Auth, Bearer Token, header propagation)
* Response/request logging and caching filters
* GZIP compression/decompression interceptors
* Request/response body validation
* Complete CRUD operations combining all concepts
* E-commerce domain examples (Product, Order, Payment services)

** Best Practices **

* Security considerations (SSL/TLS configuration, sensitive data handling)
* Performance optimization (connection timeouts, resource cleanup, scope selection)
* Testing strategies (mocking, CDI alternatives)
* Configuration management (externalization, environment-specific settings)
* Error handling patterns (domain-specific exceptions, priority ordering)

All dependency versions updated to MicroProfile Rest Client 4.0 with Maven and Gradle configurations.

## Updated Dependencies

All code examples throughout the tutorial have been updated to use:

* **MicroProfile 7.1**: The umbrella specification including all platform APIs
* **MicroProfile Rest Client 4.0**: For type-safe REST service consumption
* **Jakarta EE 10 Core Profile**: The foundation for cloud-native microservices

## Migration Guide

If you're upgrading from MicroProfile 6.1 to 7.1:

1. **Update your dependencies** in `pom.xml` or `build.gradle`:
   ```xml
   <dependency>
       <groupId>org.eclipse.microprofile</groupId>
       <artifactId>microprofile</artifactId>
       <version>7.1</version>
       <type>pom</type>
       <scope>provided</scope>
   </dependency>
   ```

2. **Update Rest Client configuration** to use the simpler `baseUri(String)` method where applicable

3. **Verify CDI injection** uses `@RestClient` qualifier explicitly

4. **Test your application** with Jakarta EE 10-compatible runtime

For detailed migration guidance and complete code examples, see the updated chapters in this tutorial.

## Version and Branch Strategy

This repository uses a **branch-per-version** strategy to maintain documentation and code examples for different MicroProfile releases. Each MicroProfile version has its own dedicated branch, ensuring long-term maintainability and clear separation between versions.

### Why Version-Specific Branches?

We maintain separate branches for each MicroProfile version instead of using a single `main` branch because:

**1. Long-term Version Maintenance**

* Each MicroProfile version follows its own lifecycle (6.1, 7.0, 7.1, 7.2, 8.0, etc.)
* Versions may need independent bug fixes, clarifications, or dependency updates
* With version-specific branches, we can update any version without affecting others

**2. Clear Reference Points**

* Developers often work on projects locked to specific MicroProfile versions for compatibility
* Stable branch URLs (e.g., `tree/v6.1`, `tree/v7.1`) provide permanent, bookmarkable references
* Users can easily find code examples matching their project's MicroProfile version
* Documentation URLs remain stable even as new versions are released

**3. Parallel Development**

* We can work on future versions (7.2, 8.0) while earlier versions are still stabilizing
* Separate branches allow preview/beta content without disrupting stable documentation
* Teams can contribute to different versions simultaneously

**4. Easier Comparison & Migration**

* Branches make it trivial to compare differences between versions
* Helps users understand breaking changes and migration paths (e.g., `git diff v6.1 v7.1`)
* Clear separation of version-specific code examples and API usage

**5. Antora Multi-version Support**

* Antora is specifically designed to build documentation from multiple branches
* Our build system automatically generates version-specific content (e.g., `build/site/microprofile-tutorial/6.1/` and `7.1/`)
* Users get a version selector in the UI to switch between versions seamlessly

**6. Avoiding "Moving Target" Problem**

* If we used `main` for 7.1 today, what happens when 7.2 ships?
* Version branches eliminate confusion about which version you're looking at
* Each branch represents a stable target for learners and enterprise users

### Branch Organization

|===

### Which Branch Should You Use?

Choose the branch that matches your MicroProfile version:

* **For MicroProfile 6.1 projects:** Use the `v6.1` branch
* **For MicroProfile 7.1 projects:** Use the `v7.1` branch
* **For the latest stable version:** Check the badges or releases page

### Branches vs. Releases

**Branches** (`v6.1`, `v7.1`) are living documentation:

* Can be continuously updated with fixes, improvements, and clarifications
* Antora builds the documentation site from these branches
* Used for active development and ongoing maintenance

**GitHub Releases** (`v6.1.0`, `v7.1.0`) are immutable snapshots:

* Mark official milestones (e.g., "Tutorial completed for MP 7.1")
* Provide downloadable archives of specific versions
* Useful for citations, training certifications, or enterprise policies
* Created from branch tags at significant points

You can use both: follow a branch for the latest updates, or download a specific release for a fixed reference.

### Workflow for New Versions

When creating documentation for a new MicroProfile version:

1. **Create a new version branch** from the most recent version:
+
```bash
git checkout v7.1
git checkout -b v7.2
```

2. **Update version numbers** throughout the branch:
   * `antora.yml` - Component version and display version
   * All `pom.xml` files in `code/` directory - MicroProfile and dependency versions
   * Documentation content referencing version numbers

3. **Update code examples** to use new MicroProfile features and APIs

4. **Test the build** locally before pushing:
+
```bash
antora antora-assembler.yml
```

5. **Push the branch** to the repository:
+
```bash
git push -u origin v7.2
```

6. **Update `antora-assembler.yml`** in `main` branch to include the new version in builds

7. **Create a GitHub Release** when the version reaches a stable milestone

### Building Multiple Versions

The `antora-assembler.yml` file is configured to build documentation for multiple versions simultaneously. This:

* Creates a version selector in the documentation UI
* Allows users to switch between different MicroProfile versions easily
* Builds all versions from their respective branches in a single site
* Maintains separate navigation and content for each version
