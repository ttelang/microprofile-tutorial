# What's New in MicroProfile 7.1 Tutorial

The MicroProfile Tutorial has been updated to reflect the latest features and changes in MicroProfile 7.1. The following sections highlight the key updates.

## MicroProfile Rest Client 4.0

The tutorial now covers **MicroProfile Rest Client 4.0**, which introduces several improvements:

### Key Features and Changes

**1. Jakarta EE 10 Alignment**

* MicroProfile Rest Client 4.0 has been aligned with Jakarta EE 10 to ensure compatibility with modern cloud-native applications.
* It is**not compatible** with earlier versions of Jakarta EE or Java EE.

**2. Simplified `baseUri()` Configuration**

MicroProfile Rest Client 4.0 introduces a new convenience method that eliminates boilerplate code:

```java
// Before (Rest Client 3.x): Required explicit URI creation
URI productApiUri = URI.create("http://localhost:8080/api");
ProductServiceClient client = RestClientBuilder.newBuilder()
    .baseUri(productApiUri)
    .build(ProductServiceClient.class);

// Now (Rest Client 4.0): Direct String parameter
ProductServiceClient client = RestClientBuilder.newBuilder()
    .baseUri("http://localhost:8080/api")  // No URI.create() needed!
    .build(ProductServiceClient.class);
```

This simplifies client configuration and reduces unnecessary object creation.

**3. CDI `@RestClient` Qualifier Clarification**

* The `@RestClient` qualifier is **mandatory** when injecting REST clients in CDI environments
* This requirement has been explicitly clarified in the specification to avoid ambiguity

```java
@Inject
@RestClient  // Required - not optional
private ProductServiceClient productClient;
```

**4. Filter Priority Handling**

* Implementations must honor `@Priority` annotations on client request and response filters
* Ensures predictable and consistent filter execution order across different implementations

### Tutorial Updates

**Chapter 11** has been comprehensively updated to MicroProfile Rest Client 4.0, covering the following:

** Addtional Topics Coverage **

* **Jakarta EE 10 Alignment** - Complete namespace migration (`javax.*` → `jakarta.*`), breaking changes, and compatibility benefits
* **Defining REST Client Interfaces** - `@RegisterRestClient` usage, configKey configuration, and interface design patterns
* **CDI Integration** - Mandatory `@RestClient` qualifier, scope management (`@ApplicationScoped`, `@RequestScoped`), lifecycle management
* **MicroProfile Config Integration** - Complete configuration reference (URL, timeouts, scopes, providers, SSL/TLS), configuration precedence, environment-specific overrides
* **Parameter Configuration** - `@PathParam`, `@QueryParam`, `@HeaderParam`, `@BeanParam` with practical examples
* **Request & Response Handling** - All HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH), response types (DTO, `Response`, `void`, collections), `AutoCloseable` resource management
* **JSON & Multipart Data** - JSON-B automatic serialization, JSON-B annotations, multipart file uploads, JSON-P for dynamic processing
* **Error Handling** - `ResponseExceptionMapper` implementation, priority-based exception mapping, checked vs unchecked exceptions
* **RestClientBuilder API** - Programmatic client creation with new `baseUri(String)` method, complete configuration options (timeouts, SSL, proxies), when to use vs CDI injection
* **Custom Filters & Interceptors** - ClientRequestFilter/ClientResponseFilter for HTTP-level interception (authentication, logging, header manipulation), WriterInterceptor/ReaderInterceptor for entity-level processing (compression, encryption), execution order with `@Priority`, three registration methods

** Code Examples**

* Added code examples demonstrating real-world patterns
* Authentication filters (Basic Auth, Bearer Token, header propagation)
* Response/request logging and caching filters
* GZIP compression/decompression interceptors
* Request/response body validation
* Complete CRUD operations combining all concepts
* E-commerce domain examples (Product, Order, Payment services)

** Best Practices **

* Security considerations (SSL/TLS configuration, sensitive data handling)
* Performance optimization (connection timeouts, resource cleanup, scope selection)
* Testing strategies (mocking, CDI alternatives)
* Configuration management (externalization, environment-specific settings)
* Error handling patterns (domain-specific exceptions, priority ordering)

All dependency versions updated to MicroProfile Rest Client 4.0 with Maven and Gradle configurations.

## Updated Dependencies

All code examples throughout the tutorial have been updated to use:

* **MicroProfile 7.1**: The umbrella specification including all platform APIs
* **MicroProfile Rest Client 4.0**: For type-safe REST service consumption
* **Jakarta EE 10 Core Profile**: The foundation for cloud-native microservices

## Migration Guide

If you're upgrading from MicroProfile 6.1 to 7.1:

1. **Update your dependencies** in `pom.xml` or `build.gradle`:
   ```xml
   <dependency>
       <groupId>org.eclipse.microprofile</groupId>
       <artifactId>microprofile</artifactId>
       <version>7.1</version>
       <type>pom</type>
       <scope>provided</scope>
   </dependency>
   ```

2. **Update Rest Client configuration** to use the simpler `baseUri(String)` method where applicable

3. **Verify CDI injection** uses `@RestClient` qualifier explicitly

4. **Test your application** with Jakarta EE 10-compatible runtime

For detailed migration guidance and complete code examples, see the updated chapters in this tutorial.

# Getting Started with MicroProfile Tutorial

This repository contains the documentation for the MicroProfile Tutorial, built with Antora. This README provides information on how to set up, build, and customize the documentation site.

## Version and Branch Strategy

This repository uses a **branch-per-version** strategy to maintain documentation and code examples for different MicroProfile releases. Each MicroProfile version has its own dedicated branch, ensuring long-term maintainability and clear separation between versions.

### Why Version-Specific Branches?

We maintain separate branches for each MicroProfile version instead of using a single `main` branch because:

**1. Long-term Version Maintenance**

* Each MicroProfile version follows its own lifecycle (6.1, 7.0, 7.1, 7.2, 8.0, etc.)
* Versions may need independent bug fixes, clarifications, or dependency updates
* With version-specific branches, we can update any version without affecting others

**2. Clear Reference Points**

* Developers often work on projects locked to specific MicroProfile versions for compatibility
* Stable branch URLs (e.g., `tree/v6.1`, `tree/v7.1`) provide permanent, bookmarkable references
* Users can easily find code examples matching their project's MicroProfile version
* Documentation URLs remain stable even as new versions are released

**3. Parallel Development**

* We can work on future versions (7.2, 8.0) while earlier versions are still stabilizing
* Separate branches allow preview/beta content without disrupting stable documentation
* Teams can contribute to different versions simultaneously

**4. Easier Comparison & Migration**

* Branches make it trivial to compare differences between versions
* Helps users understand breaking changes and migration paths (e.g., `git diff v6.1 v7.1`)
* Clear separation of version-specific code examples and API usage

**5. Antora Multi-version Support**

* Antora is specifically designed to build documentation from multiple branches
* Our build system automatically generates version-specific content (e.g., `build/site/microprofile-tutorial/6.1/` and `7.1/`)
* Users get a version selector in the UI to switch between versions seamlessly

**6. Avoiding "Moving Target" Problem**

* If we used `main` for 7.1 today, what happens when 7.2 ships?
* Version branches eliminate confusion about which version you're looking at
* Each branch represents a stable target for learners and enterprise users

### Branch Organization

[cols="1,2,2"]
|===
|Branch |MicroProfile Version |Status

|`v6.1`
|6.1
|Stable - maintenance mode

|`v7.1`
|7.1
|Active development

|`main`
|Landing/Navigation
|README and Antora configuration

|Future: `v7.2`, `v8.0`
|7.2, 8.0
|Not yet created

|===

### Which Branch Should You Use?

Choose the branch that matches your MicroProfile version:

* **For MicroProfile 6.1 projects:** Use the `v6.1` branch
* **For MicroProfile 7.1 projects:** Use the `v7.1` branch
* **For the latest stable version:** Check the badges or releases page

### Branches vs. Releases

**Branches** (`v6.1`, `v7.1`) are living documentation:

* Can be continuously updated with fixes, improvements, and clarifications
* Antora builds the documentation site from these branches
* Used for active development and ongoing maintenance

**GitHub Releases** (`v6.1.0`, `v7.1.0`) are immutable snapshots:

* Mark official milestones (e.g., "Tutorial completed for MP 7.1")
* Provide downloadable archives of specific versions
* Useful for citations, training certifications, or enterprise policies
* Created from branch tags at significant points

You can use both: follow a branch for the latest updates, or download a specific release for a fixed reference.

### Workflow for New Versions

When creating documentation for a new MicroProfile version:

1. **Create a new version branch** from the most recent version:
+
```bash
git checkout v7.1
git checkout -b v7.2
```

2. **Update version numbers** throughout the branch:
   * `antora.yml` - Component version and display version
   * All `pom.xml` files in `code/` directory - MicroProfile and dependency versions
   * Documentation content referencing version numbers

3. **Update code examples** to use new MicroProfile features and APIs

4. **Test the build** locally before pushing:
+
```bash
antora antora-assembler.yml
```

5. **Push the branch** to the repository:
+
```bash
git push -u origin v7.2
```

6. **Update `antora-assembler.yml`** in `main` branch to include the new version in builds

7. **Create a GitHub Release** when the version reaches a stable milestone

### Building Multiple Versions

The `antora-assembler.yml` file is configured to build documentation for multiple versions simultaneously. This:

* Creates a version selector in the documentation UI
* Allows users to switch between different MicroProfile versions easily
* Builds all versions from their respective branches in a single site
* Maintains separate navigation and content for each version

## Prerequisites

### Install Antora 
You need to https://docs.antora.org/antora/latest/install-and-run-quickstart/#install-antora[install Antora] using npm. If you don't have Node.js installed, you can https://docs.antora.org/antora/latest/install-and-run-quickstart/#install-nodejs[install Node.js] by following this instructions.

```
npm install -g @antora/cli @antora/site-generator-default 
```

### Recommended VS Code Extensions

For the best experience editing AsciiDoc files in Visual Studio Code, we recommend installing the following extensions:

* AsciiDoc extension by Asciidoctor (`asciidoctor.asciidoctor-vscode`) - Provides rich language support for AsciiDoc
* Auto Open Preview Panel (`matt-rudge.auto-open-preview-panel`) - Opens preview automatically when opening AsciiDoc files

## Building the Documentation Site

You can build the site by running the following commands in the root directory of the project:

```
./update-repo-url.sh
antora antora-assembler.yml
./fix-edit-links.sh
```

- The first command ensures that the repository URLs are up-to-date. 
- The second command will generate the site in the `build/site` directory. 
- The third command fixes the "Edit this Page" links to properly point to GitHub instead of local file paths.

Alternatively, you can use the following one-liner:

```
./update-repo-url.sh && antora antora-assembler.yml && ./fix-edit-links.sh
```

## Running the Site Locally

You can run the site locally using Python's built-in HTTP server. First, navigate to the `build/site` directory:
```
cd build/site
```
Then, run the following command:
```
python3 -m http.server 8080
```
This will start a local server on port 8080. You can then open your web browser and navigate to `http://<hostname>:8080` to view the site.

[TIP]
====
If port 8080 is already in use, you can free it by finding and stopping the process using it. For example, on Linux or macOS:
+
----
lsof -i :8080
kill <PID>
----
Replace `<PID>` with the process ID shown in the output.
====

## Development Workflow

To streamline the development process, a development server script is included that can automatically rebuild the documentation when files change.

### Using the Development Server

The `dev-server.sh` script provides three commands:

1. **Build only**:
+
----
./dev-server.sh build
----
+
This builds the documentation site once.

2. **Build and serve**:
+
----
./dev-server.sh serve
----
+
This builds the documentation site and starts a local HTTP server on port 8080.

3. **Build, serve, and watch for changes**:
+
----
./dev-server.sh watch
----
+
This builds the documentation site, starts a local HTTP server, and automatically rebuilds the site when files change.

### Requirements

The development server requires:

- Python 3 (for the HTTP server)
- inotify-tools (for file watching, will be automatically installed if missing)

### Typical Development Workflow

1. Start the development server in watch mode: `./dev-server.sh watch`
2. Open your browser at http://localhost:8080
3. Edit AsciiDoc files in the `modules/ROOT/pages/` directory
4. Save your changes and see them automatically reflected in the browser

## Understanding Antora Configuration

Antora uses several configuration files to manage the documentation site. The main files are:

- `antora-assembler.yml`: The primary configuration file that defines the site structure, UI bundle, and supplemental files.
- `antora.yml`: Component configuration for the MicroProfile Tutorial, including metadata and edit URL configuration.
- `supplemental-ui/`: Directory containing customizations like favicons and custom partials.

### Site Structure Configuration

The main configuration file for the site is `antora-assembler.yml`, which defines:

- **Site metadata**: Title, URL, and starting page
- **Content sources**: Where to find documentation content
- **UI bundle**: The theme and UI components to use
- **Output**: Where to generate the site
- **Asciidoc attributes**: Global attributes for all pages

Here's a breakdown of the key sections:

#### Site Information
[source,yaml]
----
site:
  title: MicroProfile Tutorial
  url: https://microprofile.io
  start_page: microprofile-tutorial::index.adoc
  keys:
    show_edit_page_link: true
----

#### Content Sources
[source,yaml]
----
content:
  sources:
    - url: .
      start_path: .
      branches: HEAD
----

#### UI Configuration
[source,yaml]
----
ui:
  bundle:
    url: https://github.com/microprofile/microprofile-tutorial-ui/releases/download/latest/ui-bundle.zip
    snapshot: true
  supplemental_files: ./supplemental-ui
----

### Component Configuration

The `antora.yml` file defines the documentation component:

[source,yaml]
----
name: microprofile-tutorial
title: MicroProfile Tutorial
version: 6.1
edit_url: https://github.com/microprofile/microprofile-tutorial/tree/main/modules/ROOT/pages/{path}
asciidoc:
  attributes:
    source-language: asciidoc@
    table-caption: false
    xrefstyle: full
nav:
  - modules/ROOT/pages/nav.adoc
start_page: index.adoc
----

Key properties:

- **name**: The component name used in xrefs and URLs
- **title**: The human-readable title
- **version**: The component version (appears in URLs and version selector)
- **edit_url**: The URL template for "Edit this Page" links
- **nav**: The navigation file(s) for the component
- **start_page**: The default page when accessing the component root

### Navigation Configuration

The navigation is defined in `modules/ROOT/pages/nav.adoc` and uses AsciiDoc with special Antora directives:

[source,asciidoc]
----
* xref:index.adoc[Home]
* xref:chapter01/chapter01.adoc[Chapter 1: Introduction]
* Chapter 2: Getting Started
** xref:chapter02/chapter02-01.adoc[Section 2.1: Environment Setup]
----

The navigation structure directly affects the sidebar menu in the generated site.

## Navigation and Site Structure

The navigation system in Antora is a critical component that determines how users find and access content. Understanding how navigation works can help you create a better user experience.

### Navigation Components

The MicroProfile Tutorial site navigation consists of:

1. **Main Navigation**: Defined in `modules/ROOT/pages/nav.adoc`, controls the sidebar navigation.
2. **Breadcrumbs**: Shows the current page's location in the content hierarchy.
3. **Previous/Next Links**: Helps users navigate sequentially through content.
4. **Table of Contents**: Generated from page headings, provides in-page navigation.

### Customizing Navigation

The navigation can be customized in several ways:

#### Modifying the nav.adoc File

The main navigation structure is defined in `modules/ROOT/pages/nav.adoc`:

[source,asciidoc]
----
* xref:index.adoc[Home]
* xref:chapter01/chapter01.adoc[Chapter 1: Introduction]
* Chapter 2: Getting Started
** xref:chapter02/chapter02-01.adoc[Section 2.1: Environment Setup]
** xref:chapter02/chapter02-02.adoc[Section 2.2: First Steps]
----

Navigation entries can be:

- Direct links to pages (with `xref:`)
- Unlinked category headers (without `xref:`)
- Nested to create hierarchical structures (using multiple `*` characters)

#### Navigation UI Customization

To customize the navigation appearance:

1. **Style Overrides**: Add CSS for navigation elements in your supplemental UI files.
2. **Template Customization**: Override the navigation templates in the UI bundle.
3. **JavaScript Enhancements**: Add interactive features like search, filtering, or collapsible sections.

Example CSS customization for navigation:

[source,css]
----
/* Customizing the sidebar navigation */
.nav-menu {
  background-color: #f5f5f5;
}

.nav-item.is-current-page > .nav-link {
  color: #0d5aa7;
  font-weight: bold;
}
----

### Navigation Best Practices

1. **Logical Organization**: Group related content together in the navigation.
2. **Consistent Naming**: Use consistent naming conventions for pages and sections.
3. **Limited Nesting**: Avoid deep nesting (more than 3 levels) to prevent navigation complexity.
4. **Descriptive Labels**: Use clear, descriptive labels for navigation items.
5. **Progressive Disclosure**: Organize content from basic to advanced topics.

### Advanced Navigation Features

The UI bundle can be customized to include advanced navigation features:

1. **Search Integration**: Add search functionality to help users find content quickly.
2. **Version Selector**: Allow users to switch between different versions of the documentation.
3. **Component Selector**: If you have multiple components, provide a way to navigate between them.
4. **Tag-Based Navigation**: Group content by tags or categories for alternative navigation paths.

## About the fix-edit-links.sh Script

The `fix-edit-links.sh` script is a necessary post-processing step in the build process. Despite having `edit_url` properly configured in `antora.yml`, when building from a local repository (`url: .` in `antora-assembler.yml`), Antora generates edit links that point to local file paths instead of GitHub URLs.

The script performs a simple text replacement in the generated HTML files, replacing local file paths with proper GitHub repository URLs. This ensures that the "Edit this Page" links work correctly for users viewing the documentation.

If you update the repository URL or branch name, make sure to update the replacement URL in the `fix-edit-links.sh` script accordingly. The current implementation assumes the GitHub repository URL is `https://github.com/microprofile/microprofile-tutorial` and the branch is `main`.

## Automating Repository URL Configuration

To simplify the management of repository URLs across configuration files, the `update-repo-url.sh` script is provided. This script:

1. Automatically detects your Git repository URL and current branch
2. Updates the `edit_url` in `antora.yml`
3. Updates the repository information in `fix-edit-links.sh`

### Using the URL Configuration Script

Run the script before building the documentation:

```
./update-repo-url.sh
```

This ensures that both the Antora configuration and the fix-edit-links script use the same repository URL and branch, eliminating duplication and reducing the chance of errors.

When you clone the repository or switch branches, run this script to update the configuration automatically.

## Customizing the Documentation Site

The MicroProfile Tutorial documentation site can be customized in various ways to enhance its appearance and functionality. Here are the key customization options:

### Favicon Configuration

Favicons are configured using the `supplemental-ui/partials/head-meta.hbs` file, which is included in the HTML `<head>` section of each page. The current setup includes:

- An SVG favicon (primary)
- A PNG favicon (fallback for browsers that don't support SVG)

To change the favicons:

1. Replace the files in `supplemental-ui/img/`:
   - `favicon.svg` - Vector version of the favicon
   - `favicon.png` - Bitmap version of the favicon
2. Make sure the references in `head-meta.hbs` match your file names

### UI Customization

The UI bundle is defined in `antora-assembler.yml` under the `ui.bundle.url` key. The current configuration uses a custom UI bundle from the `microprofile-documentation-ui` repository.

To apply additional customizations:

1. Add or modify files in the `supplemental-ui/` directory:
   - `partials/` - Override specific UI components
   - `css/` - Add custom CSS styles
   - `js/` - Add custom JavaScript

Common customizations include:

- Header and footer modifications
- Custom CSS for branding
- Additional JavaScript functionality

### Edit Page Links

Edit page links are configured in two places:

1. `antora.yml` - The `edit_url` property defines the base URL for edit links
2. `antora-assembler.yml` - The `site.keys.show_edit_page_link` property enables the display of edit links

If you change the repository URL or branch, update both:
- The `edit_url` in `antora.yml`
- The replacement URL in `fix-edit-links.sh`

### Redirection Configuration

The project includes a `redirect.html` file that automatically redirects users from the root URL to the latest version of the documentation. This is particularly useful when hosting the documentation on GitHub Pages or other static hosting services.

The redirect is configured to:
- Use relative URLs for maximum compatibility
- Fall back to JavaScript-based redirection if needed

### Further Customization Resources

For more advanced customization options, refer to the Antora documentation:

- [Antora UI Documentation](https://docs.antora.org/antora-ui-default/)
- [Customizing the UI](https://docs.antora.org/antora/latest/playbook/ui-supplemental-files/)
- [Page Templates](https://docs.antora.org/antora/latest/templates/)

## Contributing to the Documentation

### Directory Structure

The MicroProfile Tutorial follows the standard Antora directory structure:

- `modules/ROOT/pages/` - Contains the main documentation content in AsciiDoc format
- `modules/ROOT/assets/images/` - Contains images used in the documentation

### AsciiDoc Best Practices

When contributing to the documentation, follow these AsciiDoc best practices:

1. Use proper heading levels (start with `==` for top-level headings within a page)
2. Use cross-references to link between pages (`xref:page-id.adoc[]`)
3. Add proper metadata to each page:
+
----
= Page Title
:page-id: unique-id
----
+
4. For code examples, use proper language specifiers:
+
----
[source,java]
----
// Java code here
----
----

### Adding New Content

To add new content to the documentation:

1. Create a new `.adoc` file in the appropriate directory under `modules/ROOT/pages/`
2. Add a reference to the new page in the navigation file (`modules/ROOT/pages/nav.adoc`)
3. Build the site to verify your changes

### Handling Images

When adding images to the documentation:

1. Place image files in the `modules/ROOT/images/` directory
2. Reference images using the `image::` directive:
+
----
image::image-name.png[Alt text for the image, width=600]
----

## Troubleshooting

### Common Build Issues

1. **Missing dependencies**
   ```
   npm install -g @antora/cli @antora/site-generator-default
   ```

2. **Edit links not working**
   - Make sure `fix-edit-links.sh` is executable: `chmod +x fix-edit-links.sh`
   - Verify the GitHub repository URL and branch in both `antora.yml` and `fix-edit-links.sh`

3. **Incorrect links in navigation**
   - Check that page references in `nav.adoc` use proper xref syntax
   - Verify that page IDs are unique across the documentation

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues not covered in this documentation, check the following resources:

- [Antora Documentation](https://docs.antora.org/)
- [AsciiDoc Syntax Quick Reference](https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/syntax-quick-reference/)

## Hosting and Deployment

The MicroProfile Tutorial documentation site is designed to be deployed as static HTML, which can be hosted on various platforms. Here are some common hosting options and deployment methods:

### GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages is a simple and free hosting option for static sites:

1. Build the site: `antora antora-assembler.yml && ./fix-edit-links.sh`
2. Copy the contents of the `build/site` directory to your GitHub Pages branch (typically `gh-pages`)
3. Configure GitHub repository settings to enable GitHub Pages

The `redirect.html` file can be renamed to `index.html` at the repository root to automatically redirect visitors to the latest documentation version.

### Static Web Hosting

Any static web hosting service can host the documentation:

1. Build the site: `antora antora-assembler.yml && ./fix-edit-links.sh`
2. Upload the contents of the `build/site` directory to your web server
3. Configure your web server to serve `index.html` as the default document

### Continuous Integration

To automate the build and deployment process, you can use GitHub Actions or another CI/CD system:

1. Set up a workflow that triggers on pushes to the main branch
2. Configure the workflow to:
   - Install Node.js and required dependencies
   - Run the Antora build
   - Execute the fix-edit-links script
   - Deploy the generated site to your hosting platform

Example GitHub Actions workflow file (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`):

[source,yaml]
----
name: Deploy Documentation

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '16'
          
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install -g @antora/cli @antora/site-generator-default
        
      - name: Build site
        run: |
          antora antora-assembler.yml
          chmod +x ./fix-edit-links.sh
          ./fix-edit-links.sh
          
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: ./build/site
----

### Custom Domain Configuration

If you're hosting the documentation on a custom domain:

1. Update the `site.url` property in `antora-assembler.yml` to match your domain
2. Configure your domain's DNS settings to point to your hosting provider
3. If using GitHub Pages, add a CNAME file to the `build/site` directory

## GitHub Actions Workflow for Automated Deployment

The MicroProfile Tutorial documentation is automatically built and deployed using a GitHub Actions workflow. This section explains the workflow configuration and how it ensures continuous deployment of the documentation.

### Workflow Overview

The repository includes a comprehensive GitHub Actions workflow (`antora.yml`) that:

- **Validates builds on pull requests** without deploying
- **Automatically deploys** to GitHub Pages when changes are pushed to the main branch  
- **Handles concurrent deployments** to prevent conflicts
- **Ensures GitHub Pages is enabled** automatically

### Workflow Configuration

The workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/build-and-deploy-tutorials.yml` and includes two main jobs:

#### 1. Pull Request Validation (`validate-build`)

This job runs on pull requests and validates that the documentation builds correctly:

- **Triggers**: Pull requests to the main branch
- **Purpose**: Validates documentation builds without deploying
- **Steps**:
  * Checkout repository code
  * Set up Node.js environment with npm caching
  * Install Antora CLI and site generator
  * Generate the site to validate build success
  * Verify build output exists

#### 2. Build and Deploy (`build-and-deploy`)

This job runs on pushes to the main branch and deploys the documentation:

- **Triggers**: Pushes to main branch, manual workflow dispatch
- **Purpose**: Build and deploy documentation to GitHub Pages
- **Environment**: Uses `github-pages` environment for deployment tracking
- **Steps**:
  * Checkout repository code
  * Set up Node.js environment with npm caching
  * Install Antora CLI and site generator
  * Verify Antora installation
  * Generate site using Antora with `--fetch` and `--stacktrace` options
  * Configure GitHub Pages settings
  * Upload generated site as artifact
  * Deploy to GitHub Pages

### Key Features

#### Concurrency Control
```yaml
concurrency:
  group: "pages"
  cancel-in-progress: false
```
Prevents multiple deployments from running simultaneously while allowing in-progress deployments to complete.

#### Automatic Pages Enablement
The workflow automatically enables GitHub Pages if it's not already configured, ensuring the repository is properly set up for deployment.

#### Environment Protection
Uses the `github-pages` environment for deployment tracking and provides the deployment URL after successful completion.

#### Performance Optimizations
- **npm caching**: Speeds up Node.js setup
- **Conditional deployment**: Only deploys from main branch pushes
- **Comprehensive error handling**: Includes verification steps and detailed logging

### Required Permissions

The workflow requires specific GitHub token permissions:

```yaml
permissions:
  id-token: write  # Required for OIDC authentication to GitHub Pages
  contents: read   # Required to read repository contents and checkout code
  pages: write     # Required to deploy artifacts to GitHub Pages
```

### Deployment Process

When code is pushed to the main branch:

1. **Build Validation**: The workflow validates that Antora can successfully build the site
2. **Site Generation**: Antora processes the `antora-assembler.yml` configuration and generates the static site
3. **Pages Configuration**: GitHub Pages is automatically configured if needed
4. **Artifact Upload**: The generated site (`./build/site`) is uploaded as a deployment artifact
5. **Deployment**: The artifact is deployed to GitHub Pages

### Accessing the Deployed Site

After successful deployment, the documentation is available at:
```
https://<username>.github.io/<repository-name>/
```

For the MicroProfile Tutorial, this would be:
```
https://microprofile.github.io/microprofile-tutorial/
```

### Monitoring Deployments

You can monitor deployment status through:

- **GitHub Actions tab**: View workflow runs and their status
- **Environment tab**: Track deployments to the `github-pages` environment  
- **Settings > Pages**: Verify GitHub Pages configuration
- **Repository insights**: View deployment frequency and success rates

### Troubleshooting Workflow Issues

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Build Failures**:
   - Check the workflow logs for Antora errors
   - Verify `antora-assembler.yml` configuration
   - Ensure all referenced content sources are accessible

2. **Deployment Failures**:
   - Verify GitHub Pages is enabled in repository settings
   - Check that the workflow has necessary permissions
   - Ensure the repository has GitHub Pages configured

3. **Content Not Updating**:
   - Check if the workflow completed successfully
   - Verify the build generated the expected output
   - Clear browser cache to see latest changes

### Workflow Customization

To customize the workflow for your needs:

1. **Change trigger conditions**: Modify the `on:` section to change when the workflow runs
2. **Update Node.js version**: Change the Node.js version in the setup step
3. **Add build steps**: Include additional processing steps before or after Antora
4. **Configure notifications**: Add steps to notify team members of deployment status

### Migration from Static Deployment

Previously, the repository included a `static.yml` workflow that deployed raw repository content. This has been removed in favor of the Antora-based workflow because:

- **Proper documentation processing**: Antora generates a structured documentation site
- **Better navigation**: Antora provides proper navigation and cross-references
- **Improved maintenance**: Single workflow eliminates deployment conflicts
- **Enhanced features**: Support for themes, search, and multi-version documentation

## Future Improvements

Consider these potential improvements to the documentation site:

1. **Multi-version documentation**: Configure Antora to build multiple versions of the documentation from different branches or tags
2. **Search integration**: Add a custom search engine like Algolia DocSearch
3. **Analytics**: Integrate web analytics to track usage patterns
4. **PDF generation**: Enhance the PDF export capabilities with custom styling
5. **Interactive examples**: Add interactive code examples using tools like Asciidoctor-Kroki for diagrams

## Managing Dependencies and Updates

### Node.js Dependencies

The MicroProfile Tutorial documentation relies on Node.js packages, primarily Antora. These dependencies are listed in the `package.json` file. To update or manage these dependencies:

1. **Update all dependencies**:
+
----
npm update
----

2. **Install a specific Antora version**:
+
----
npm install -g @antora/cli@3.1.0 @antora/site-generator-default@3.1.0
----

### Understanding the UI Bundle

The UI bundle is a critical component of an Antora site that controls the overall appearance, layout, and functionality of the documentation. It's defined in `antora-assembler.yml` under the `ui.bundle` section.

#### Current UI Bundle Configuration

The MicroProfile Tutorial uses a customized UI bundle from the `microprofile-documentation-ui` repository:

[source,yaml]
----
ui:
  bundle:
    url: https://github.com/microprofile/microprofile-tutorial-ui/releases/tag/latest/ui-bundle.zip
    snapshot: true
  supplemental_files: ./supplemental-ui
----

Key properties in this configuration:

* `url`: Specifies the location of the UI bundle ZIP file
* `snapshot: true`: Tells Antora to fetch the bundle every time you build, ignoring any cached version
* `supplemental_files`: Points to a directory containing files that override or extend the UI bundle

#### UI Bundle Components

A standard Antora UI bundle includes:

* **CSS styles**: Controls the visual appearance of the site
* **JavaScript files**: Provides interactive functionality
* **Handlebars templates**: Defines the HTML structure of pages
* **Fonts and images**: Basic visual assets
* **Layouts**: Page structure templates for different content types

#### Customizing the UI Bundle

There are three approaches to customizing the UI:

1. **Using supplemental files** (current approach):
   * Add files to the `supplemental-ui/` directory
   * These files override or extend the UI bundle without modifying it
   * Good for simple customizations like favicons, headers, footers, and CSS tweaks

2. **Creating a custom UI bundle**:
   * Fork the default Antora UI repository
   * Make extensive customizations
   * Build and host your custom bundle
   * Reference your custom bundle URL in `antora-assembler.yml`

3. **Using a community UI bundle**:
   * Several alternative UI bundles are available in the Antora ecosystem
   * Each offers different features, layouts, and styling options

#### Updating the UI Bundle

To update to a newer version of the UI bundle:

1. Check for new releases of the UI bundle at the GitHub repository
2. Update the URL in `antora-assembler.yml`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
ui:
  bundle:
    url: https://github.com/microprofile/microprofile-tutorial-ui/releases/tag/latest/ui-bundle.zip
    snapshot: true
----

#### Creating a Custom UI Bundle

If you need extensive customization beyond what supplemental files allow:

1. Fork the https://github.com/microprofile/microprofile-tutorial-ui repository
2. Make your customizations following the project's README
3. Build the UI bundle using `gulp bundle`
4. Host the resulting ZIP file (e.g., on GitHub Releases)
5. Update the `url` in `antora-assembler.yml` to point to your custom bundle

This approach provides the most flexibility but requires more maintenance.

## Advanced UI Bundle Configuration

The UI bundle configuration in Antora offers several advanced options that can enhance the documentation site's functionality and performance.

### Bundle Cache Control

You can control how Antora handles UI bundle caching:

[source,yaml]
----
ui:
  bundle:
    url: https://github.com/microprofile/microprofile-tutorial-ui/releases/download/latest/ui-bundle.zip
    snapshot: true  # Always fetch the latest version
    # snapshot: false  # Use cached version when available
----

Setting `snapshot: false` can improve build performance by using a cached version of the bundle.

### Custom UI Bundle Features

Modern UI bundles for Antora can include advanced features:

1. **Search Integration**: Many UI bundles include built-in search functionality:
+
[source,yaml]
----
ui:
  bundle:
    url: https://github.com/microprofile/microprofile-tutorial-ui/releases/download/latest/ui-bundle.zip
  supplemental_files: ./supplemental-ui
search:
  engine: lunr  # Or another search engine
  index_latest_only: true
----

2. **Multiple Output Formats**: Some UI bundles support different output formats:
+
[source,yaml]
----
ui:
  bundle:
    url: https://github.com/microprofile/microprofile-tutorial-ui/releases/download/latest/ui-bundle.zip
output:
  dir: ./build/site
  formats:
    - html
    - pdf
----

3. **SEO Optimizations**: Enhanced metadata for search engines:
+
[source,yaml]
----
site:
  title: MicroProfile Tutorial
  url: https://microprofile.io
  keys:
    seo_description: Comprehensive tutorial for learning MicroProfile
    seo_keywords: microprofile, java, cloud-native, microservices
----

### Using a Local UI Bundle

For development or customization, you can use a local UI bundle:

[source,yaml]
----
ui:
  bundle:
    url: ./path/to/local/ui-bundle.zip
    snapshot: true
----

Replease _./path/to/local/ui-bundle.zip_ with actual path to your local UI bundle under development.

This approach is useful when developing your own UI bundle or testing modifications.

### UI Bundle Development

If you decide to develop your own UI bundle:

1. **Prerequisites**: Node.js and Gulp
2. **Project Structure**:
   - `src/`: Source files (CSS, JavaScript, Handlebars templates)
   - `gulp.d/`: Gulp tasks for building the bundle
   - `preview-src/`: Sample content for testing
3. **Build Process**:
   - Run `gulp bundle` to create the UI bundle
   - Use `gulp preview` to test with sample content

### Performance Optimization Tips

To optimize the performance of your documentation site:

1. **Minification**: Ensure CSS and JavaScript are minified
2. **Image Optimization**: Use optimized images and consider lazy loading
3. **Font Subsetting**: Only include the character sets you need
4. **Resource Caching**: Configure proper caching headers
5. **CDN Integration**: Consider hosting assets on a CDN

### Debugging UI Issues

When troubleshooting UI problems:

1. Use browser developer tools to inspect elements and styles
2. Check the browser console for JavaScript errors
3. Verify that all required resources are loading correctly
4. Test with different browsers to identify browser-specific issues
