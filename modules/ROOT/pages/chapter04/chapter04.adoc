== Introduction 

In the previous chapter, we saw how RESTful APIs facilitate language-agnostic access to web services from diverse environments. However, a clear and comprehensive contract is required to ensure seamless integration between clients and services. This need for a well-defined API contract has led to the adoption of the OpenAPI specification.
This chapter will explore the primary features of MicroProfile OpenAPI, demonstrate how to integrate it into your MicroProfile applications, and show you how to annotate your RESTful services to produce rich documentation that adheres to the OpenAPI specification. Furthermore, we will introduce the OpenAPI UI, a visual interface allowing developers and stakeholders to interact with and visualize the documented APIs, enhancing understanding and facilitating integration.

== OpenAPI Specification

The Open API Specification (OAS), formerly the Swagger specification, is a technical specification that allows REST API providers to describe and publish their APIs using a format that various tools can consume. It defines a standard, language-agnostic interface to RESTful APIs, making it easy for third-party tools to generate documentation, client SDKs, and a range of tools that promote the seamless consumption of RESTful APIs.

NOTE: The OpenAPI Initiative, a consortium of industry experts committed to standardizing how to describe REST APIs, maintains the OpenAPI Specification. It is a community-driven initiative, and many large organizations use it, including Google, Microsoft, and Amazon.

The OpenAPI specification enables the creation of a well-defined, clear, and comprehensive API contract. It provides a standardized way to describe the API's structure, expected requests and responses, and authentication mechanisms, making it easier to develop, test, and maintain RESTful APIs.

== Introduction to MicroProfile OpenAPI

The MicroProfile OpenAPI specification builds upon the widely recognized OpenAPI Specification (OAS) and leverages annotations from the Jakarta Restful Web Services specification. The primary focus of MicroProfile OpenAPI is on defining REST APIs that utilize JSON within the context of HTTP.

The specification aims to provide a uniform way of describing APIs so that they are both human-readable and machine-readable.  It facilitates the creation of APIs that are consistent, well-documented, and easily consumable by both humans and machines. 

== Capabilities of MicroProfile OpenAPI Specification

MicroProfile OpenAPI provides a suite of Java APIs that allows developers to define and generate API specifications that adhere to OpenAPI v3 standards. As a result, it simplifies the process of designing, documenting, and publishing RESTful APIs for developers. 

Developers can quickly generate documentation for their microservices using MicroProfile OpenAPI. The documentation includes information on what services are provided, how to invoke them, and what data types are used. It generates comprehensive metadata about services, ensuring interoperability across diverse platforms and tools. Also, documentation can generate client code to access the web services.

The OpenAPI Specification fuels a rich ecosystem of tools that automate and support. This specification streamlines the creation of OpenAPI documentation for RESTful services using a unified approach. It generates comprehensive metadata about services, ensuring interoperability across diverse platforms and tools:

* *API Documentation Generation*: Intuitive interactive documentation portals emerge directly from the specification.
* *Client SDK Creation*: Client libraries in various languages can be automatically generated.
* *API Testing*: Testing frameworks can leverage the specification to design robust tests.
* *API Mocking*: Simplifies mocking APIs for testing and development purposes.

== OpenAPI v3.1 and JSON Schema 2020-12 Alignment

MicroProfile OpenAPI 4.0 aligns with the OpenAPI v3.1 specification. OpenAPI v3.1 fully embraces JSON Schema 2020-12, providing more powerful and precise validation capabilities to developers.

=== Key Features of OpenAPI v3.1

==== Pattern Validation

OpenAPI v3.1 supports full regular expression pattern validation for string fields. This enables precise format validation for structured strings like SKU codes, email addresses, and custom identifiers.

[source, java]
----
@Schema(
    description = "Stock Keeping Unit - unique product identifier",
    pattern = "^[A-Z]{3}-[A-Z0-9]+-[A-Z0-9]+$",
    example = "ELC-MS001-BLK"
)
private String sku;
----

This pattern ensures the SKU follows the format: three uppercase letters, a dash, alphanumeric characters, another dash, and more alphanumeric characters (e.g., `ELC-MS001-BLK`, `CLO-TSH123-RED`).

==== Exclusive Numeric Bounds

OpenAPI v3.1 introduces improved numeric constraint handling with `exclusiveMinimum` and `exclusiveMaximum`. It allows developers to work with minimum/maximum values for precise bounds.

[source, java]
----
@Schema(
    description = "Product price in USD",
    minimum = "0.01",
    exclusiveMinimum = true,  // Price must be > 0.01, not >= 0.01
    multipleOf = 0.01,
    format = "double",
    example = "29.99"
)
private Double price;
----

This ensures prices are greater than $0.01 (not equal to) and rounded to 2 decimal places using `multipleOf`.

==== Format Specifications

OpenAPI v3.1 provides standardized format validation for common data types, improving type safety and validation:

[source, java]
----
@Schema(
    description = "Product ID",
    format = "int64",  // Specifies 64-bit integer
    minimum = "1",
    example = "1"
)
private Long id;

@Schema(
    description = "Stock quantity",
    format = "int32",  // Specifies 32-bit integer
    minimum = "0",
    example = "100"
)
private Integer stockQuantity;

@Schema(
    description = "Creation timestamp",
    format = "date-time",  // ISO 8601 date-time format
    example = "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
)
private LocalDateTime createdAt;
----

==== Nullable Properties

OpenAPI v3.1 provides native JSON Schema support for nullable fields, making it clearer which properties can be null:

[source, java]
----
@Schema(
    description = "Product description",
    nullable = true,  // Explicitly allows null values
    maxLength = 500,
    example = "High-quality wireless mouse"
)
private String description;
----

==== Enumeration Support

Type-safe enumeration values ensure only predefined values are accepted:

[source, java]
----
@Schema(
    description = "Product category",
    enumeration = {"ELECTRONICS", "CLOTHING", "BOOKS", "HOME", "SPORTS"},
    example = "ELECTRONICS"
)
private String category;
----

==== Array Constraints

OpenAPI v3.1 allows precise control over array sizes and content:

[source, java]
----
@Schema(
    implementation = Product.class,
    type = SchemaType.ARRAY,
    minItems = 0,   // Minimum array size
    maxItems = 1000 // Maximum array size
)
public List<Product> getProducts() {
    // Method implementation
}
----

== Generating MicroProfile OpenAPI documents

There are multiple ways in which you can generate OpenAPI documents. The most common way is to use annotations. This only requires augmenting your Jakarta Restful Web Services annotations with OpenAPI annotations. 

Besides annotations, a predefined OpenAPI document may be provided in either YAML or JSON format. This so-called static model will be merged with the model generated by scanning for Jakarta REST endpoints and the combined result will be made available to clients. However, the annotation-based approach is recommended as it is more maintainable and easier to understand. Finally, you can filter out the resources you do not want to document using configuration.

== Using MicroProfile Open API in your project

To document Jakarta RESTful Web Services using MicroProfile OpenAPI, we need to annotate the resource classes and methods with the OpenAPI annotation. 

To use MicroProfile OpenAPI in your project, you need to add the following maven coordinates to your project:

[source, xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.eclipse.microprofile.openapi</groupId>
  <artifactId>microprofile-openapi-api</artifactId>
  <version>3.1.1</version>
</dependency>
----

Below is an illustrative example of how you might annotate a method in the `ProductResource` class to achieve this documentation using MicroProfile OpenAPI annotations:

[source, java]
----
import org.eclipse.microprofile.openapi.annotations.*;

import jakarta.ws.rs.GET;
//...

@ApplicationScoped
@Path("/products")
@Tag(name = "Product Resource", description = "CRUD operations for products")
public class ProductResource {

    //...

    @GET
    @Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
    @Operation(summary = "List all products", description = "Retrieves a list of all available products")
    @APIResponses(value = {
        @APIResponse(
            responseCode = "200",
            description = "Successful, list of products found",
            content = @Content(mediaType = "application/json",
                    schema = @Schema(implementation = Product.class))
        ),
        @APIResponse(
            responseCode = "400",
            description = "Unsuccessful, no products found",
            content = @Content(mediaType = "application/json")
        )
    })
    public List<Product> getAllProducts() {
        // Method implementation
    }
}
----

Explanation: 

* `@Operation`: Provides a summary and description for the `getProducts()` method.

* `@APIResponse`: Describes the possible responses from the `getProducts()` operation. In this case, a successful response (HTTP 200) is described, indicating that the method returns an array of Product entities.

* `@Schema`: Specifies the schema of the response content. Here, it is used to indicate that the method returns an array of Product objects.

These annotations enrich the `ProductResource` class with metadata necessary for generating comprehensive and descriptive OpenAPI documentation automatically.

We have also annotated the `getProducts()` method with the @APIResponse annotation to document the successful response from the operation. The `responseCode` field is used to specify the status code of the response, and the `description` field is used to provide a brief description of the response. There are two possible responses – a successful response containing a list of produdts with a 200 status code, and an unsuccessful response with a 400 status code, if no products are found. The content field is used to specify the schema of the response content. In this example, the response content is a list of `Product`s.

Finally, we need to add the following property to the src/main/resources/META-INF/microprofile-config.properties file:

----
mp.openapi.scan=true
----

This property tells MicroProfile OpenAPI to scan our classes for annotations and generate API documentation for them. 

Now that we have configured MicroProfile OpenAPI, we can build and run our application.

== How to view the generated documentation

To view the generated documentation, we can use the OpenAPI UI tool. The Open API UI tool is a web-based tool that can be used to view the documentation for a REST API.

The OpenAPI UI tool can be accessed at the following URL:

----
http://<server-host>:<port>/openapi/
----

Replace `<server-host>` and `<port>` with the actual server host name and port used by your runtime, for e.g. `http://localhost:5050/openapi`.

The `/openapi` endpoint is used to get information about the OpenAPI specification generated from the comments in the source code annotations. It returns information in YAML format.

When we access the URL, we should see the API documentation that was generated by MicroProfile OpenAPI:

[source, yaml]

          type: integer
      responses:

          type: number
----

As we can see, MicroProfile OpenAPI has generated API documentation for our resource class. We can use this documentation to learn about the API and how to use it. 

MicroProfile OpenAPI allows developers to produce these specifications directly from their codebase, leveraging annotations and/or providing OpenAPI documents statically. This direct generation ensures that the API documentation is always up to date with the code.

== Exploring the APIs using Swagger UI

To open Swagger UI for the API documentation generated using MicroProfile OpenAPI, you will need to deploy your application to a server that supports MicroProfile, such as Open Liberty, WildFly, Quarkus, or Payara Micro. These servers automatically generate the OpenAPI documentation for your RESTful services based on the annotations in your code. 

Next, visit the following URL to launch the Swagger UI: 

----
http://localhost:9080/openapi/ui
----

Swagger UI is then used to render this documentation in a user-friendly web interface. Below is the screenshot of swagger UI for the Product REST Resource.

== Annotations 

The MicroProfile OpenAPI annotations can be used to document any Jakarta Restful Web Services resource. The annotations can also be used in conjunction with other Jakarta Restful Webservices annotations, such as @Path and @Produces. The most common annotations that are used to document RESTful web services are list in Table 4-1.

|===

All of these annotations are defined in the org.eclipse.microprofile.openapi.annotations package.

== Summary

By integrating the MicroProfile OpenAPI, developers can generate detailed, OpenAPI-compliant documentation automatically, fostering better understanding and interaction among services. By annotating `ProductResource` class, we generated API documentation as per Open API specification. This will ensure the services are readily discoverable, understandable, and usable, thereby accelerating development cycles and fostering a more robust and collaborative developer ecosystem.
